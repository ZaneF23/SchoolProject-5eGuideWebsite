<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Path of the Battlerager(SCAG)</li>
    <p>
        Battlerager is a Barbarian Path exclusive to Dwarves (though your DM can easily ignore this rule) that is inpired by these Dwarves' reverence for their god of war. The only Barbarian Path that encourages the use of armor<br>
        these Barbarians make special use of Spiked Armor, a specialty of Dwarves known for its protruding spikes. To start, while I do my best to be optimistic about subclasses, and to not discourage players from trying things<br>
        this Path is very poorly designed. Having a Barbarian wear armor negates a somewhat vital part of their playstyle, and the reward you get for making that sacrifice is an unoriginal, boring, and very weak subclass. Everything you find here is done better elsewhere. If you are dedicated to this, you have my respect, and my best tip is have to fun with it rather than trying to optimize it.
    </p>
    <li>Path of the Giant(BGoG)</li>
    <p>
        These Barbarians have learned to draw their fury from the same primordial forces as Giants. When they rage, they empower themselves with a rush of elemental energy, infusing themselves with a sense of force and glory<br>
        known only to giant-kind. From levels 3 to 6, you'll want to focus on having a Thrown weapon, for a Barbarian great options are Hand Axes or Javelins. Preferably Hand Axes as they are also viable at melee range, giving you<br>
        a wider array of coverage and use of your increased reach while raging. During this time, make sure you acquire a higher damage weapon, however, as once you reach level 6, your Rage gives any weapon the Thrown property. Make sure you balance throwing the weapon with melee attacks and choose your damage type according to the current enemy. Finally, weapons with Reach prove very fun, as the increased reach stacks with your abilities, and remember Mighty Impel can be on enemies and allies.
    </p>
    <li>Path of the Juggernaut(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Juggernaut Barbarians follow a simple but unbreakable tactic. To be both the immovable object and the unstoppable force. They stand stalwart against their foes, forming an unbreakable stance and swinging with<br>
        such deterministic force that none could stand their blows. The primary strategy of this Barbarian is to prevent your enemies from grouping up, taking control of the battlefield. Use your Thunderous Blows and later your Hurricane Strike<br>
        to batter enemies away from your ranged allies and into your melee allies. These abilities are especially good for having your party single out an enemy or small group of enemies, to deal with them and then move to the next. Being a Barbarian, Resolute Stance won't be worth it most of the time, but if you need to take a barrage of blows, you fall very low, or you have a way to counteract the disadvantage, it can be.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Bard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>College of Spirits(VRGR)</li>
    <p>
        These Bards acknowledge that many of the greatest stories belong to those long passed and learn to call upon the spirits of those involved in these stories for the world to relive them. These spirits may not always listen however<br>
        and Spirit Bards tend to have less control over them than they think. Some tips, use your Guidance constantly outside of combat, it's a great addition to any check and comes at no cost to you. Also, be sure to use your Spiritual Focus<br>
        for your spells and it can be fun to theme with your character. Tales From Beyond has some very powerful effects, some essentially being spells without the use of a spell slot. Therefore, it will often be a better use of your Bardic Inspiration than the traditional functions. Remember to use Spirit Session at each rest, for a free spell of your choice, and that you do not have to be the target of your Tales From Beyonds effects, meaning it can originate from your allies.
    </p>
    <li>College of Tragedy(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Tragedy Bards are of the few who accept that most stories do not end in glory, or everlasting happiness, instead many end in the death of their hero, having achieved nothing. With this, these Bards learn that sorrow and grief<br>
        are just, if not more, powerful than the delight brought by other Bards. First off, these Bards get a very unique ability in Poetry in Misery, that lets them regain a use of Bardic Inspiration. Because it can trigger at almost any time<br>
        it can be beneficial to use a Bardic Inspiration very early in the day to not waste a trigger of this ability. Sorrowful Fate is yet another very unique ability. The latter half is just for fun, but changing a saving throw to Charisma is very specific, and it's safe to say most non-humanoid enemies will not have fantastic Charisma. An interesting tip to bend some rules is to use Impending Misfortune and then have an ally use an ability where unwilling creatures must make a saving throw or be affected in some way, such as Vortex Warp or Mighty Impel. Finally, Nimbus of Pathos is absurd, weird, and fun, and I have no clue what the best way to use it is.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Cleric</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Death Domain(DMG)</li>
    <p>
        Death Clerics were presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide as an option for evil characters or to inspire villains for a DM. However, I reject the idea that any class or subclass should be tied to a specific moral standpoint<br>
        so you should discuss with your DM the option of playing one of these characters if you are interested. These Clerics worship the idea of death, granting knowledge over the forces that bring death and influence over the negative<br>
        energies of the undead. Your spell list should be heavily taken up by Necromancy spells, as the whole subclass wants you to cast them. Necromancy spells have some very effective damage and abilities, the downside is a lot of things resist necrotic damage. And that makes your Inescapable Destruction a very helpful ability, greatly broadening your effectiveness.
    </p>
    <li>Arcana Domain(SCAG)</li>
    <p>
        Arcana Clerics understand that there does not have to be a separation between magic and the divine, especially when following under a god whose rule falls over the realm of magic. Some of these gods and Clerics<br>
        view magic as a heavy responsibility, granting its wielder the job of unraveling the universe. Others view magic as a right of power, to be used at their disposal. These Clerics can tap into spells known only to<br>
        Wizards, primarily from your Domain Spells. With Arcane Initiate, I recommend taking damage cantrips, as Clerics already have very good non-damaging options, and your damage cantrips are later enhanced by Potent Spellcasting. Finally, while this subclass isn't traditionally supportive, remember to take a few healing spells for Spell Breaker, saving some high spell slots to end dangerous effects.
    </p>
    <li>Blood Domain(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Blood Clerics acknowledge that blood is the natural life force in physical form, flowing through every true example of life. These Clerics view blood as a divine conduit, harnessing its power of life and death<br>
        and anchors the divinity of life to its mortal shell. You'll want to take plenty of damage spells, keep a few reliable healing spells, and most of your utility spells should come from your Domain Spell list. Despite<br>
        getting martial weapon proficiency and Divine Strike, I recommend focusing more on spells for your damage because of Bloodletting Focus and Sanguine Recall. Sanguine Recall also being the reason you want some nice healing spells, so you can restore the health lost to regain spell slots. Finally, your Crimson Bond can be for both allies and enemies, so try to get a vial from each teammate and anyone your team releases, and Blood Puppet can be absurdly powerful against a beefy low Wisdom enemy.
    </p>
    <li>Moon Domain(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        These Clerics recognize the divine authority of the moon or moons of their world, often seeing them as a physical manifestation of some god, and that god's method of spreading their influence over that world.<br>
        Moon Clerics align themselves with the methods of lunar bodies, mastering techniques to blend light and shadow and invoke luck and misfortune. This Domain especially favors you to have a good Constitution score<br>
        as multiple of the abilities are based around concentration, which you want to keep unbroken. Deciding between the Channel Divinity's is a tough call, but I recommend using Mind of Two Moons to cast two hindering concentration spells to better lock enemies out of combat. Blessing of the Full Moon is not bad, however, and should be kept in mind if it becomes relevant. 
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Druid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Circle of the Blighted(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Druids become wholly dedicated to the land, especially particular regions around important natural monuments, ancient creatures, or the glade where they became a Druid. Unlike other Circles, Blighted Druids do not come<br>
        from a collection of Druids united under one ideal, but rather from joint suffering. Blighted Druids have had their sacred ground corrupted by some means, twisting their connection to the natural world. Monitor when you use your Defile Ground<br>
        as it's very useful for your ability, but only has one use per short or long rest. I recommend taking a couple good summoning spells, with a very good game plan being put down Defile Ground, cast a summon spell, Wild Shape, and then rotate through attacking as your Wild Shape, keeping enemies in Defile Ground, summoning the Saplings, and blowing up your summons on death.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Fighter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Echo Knight(EGW)</li>
    <p>
        These Fighters have increased their martial prowess in an entirely unexpected way - by fighting with copies of themselves. While this sounds absurd, these Fighters have trained and learned how to bring forth<br>
        Echoes of themself, shadowy figures that represent themself from a timeline alternate to their own, or one that never came to fruition. For strategy, remember to always have an Echo active. There is no time limit<br>
        and it only goes away when destroyed or when far from you. Use your Echo to increase your coverage of the battlefield, allowing you to pressure multiple areas at once, and keep enemies pinned down. 
    </p>
    <li>Banneret(SCAG)</li>
    <p>
        Also known as Purple Dragon Knights, for Fighters, this is your play on classic knights in shining armor. Swearing fealty to a crown, guided by a code of chivalry, these Fighters venture into dangerous untamed regions<br>
        to defend the innocent, face threats to the kingdom, and lead militia into battle. These knights actively inspire their allies through their resilience and actions, which is reflected in their abilities. The main concept of<br>
        this subclass is to get more value out of Fighter's expendable features, those being Second Wind, Action Surge, and Indomitable. Because of this, you don't have to worry about subclass-specific expendable features, instead, you should think a bit harder on when to use the aforementioned ones. For Example, don't use Second Wind if you're the only one who has taken damage, and don't use Action Surge if your high-damage allies have used their reaction.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Way of the Ascendant Dragon(FTD)</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Ascendant Dragon believe that by emulating dragons, these ancient powerful beings, they will become better attuned to the world and its magic. Some, including these monks, believe dragons to be among<br>
        the first beings on the Material Plane, giving them the deepest connection to the spirit of the world. One of the perhaps less noticeable but very subtly helpful things about this subclass is that it has very little use of Ki points.<br>
        Most of its abilities either do not use them or use them for a lasting effect. The main downside to Monks in general is the constant use of Ki points, and this helps avoid that. Beyond that, I recommend activating each of your abilities at least once each combat, especially Aspect of the Wyrm. Recurring fear and damage resistance are hard to pass up.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Long Death(SCAG)</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Long Death have become fascinated with the means and mechanics of dying, taking special interest in investigating the flow of ki through dead or dying creatures. These monks often end up performing experiments<br>
        whether in the lab or in the field, to find out more about a creature's perishing moment. Then, they use this knowledge to adapt their fighting style. Touch of Long Death wants you to make your way to the back of enemy lines<br>
        and burn down each of the lower health enemies, gaining temporary health as you do so. Pairing this with Hour of Reaping is a good way to make sure it doesn't hit your party, and you can land kills more easily. Mastery of Death is incredible, allowing you to consistently avoid death for a single ki point, and Touch of the Long Death has very high burst damage potential.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Cobalt Soul(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Cobalt Soul leave some of the beliefs of a spiritual journey for a more intellectual life of study and research. These Monks watch over, defend, and maintain massive repositories of knowledge, and find special import<br>
        in truthful acts and the uncovering and guarding of dangerous mysteries. With this hoarded knowledge, these Monks truly know their enemy, and use that knowledge to win, and record their victory for future studies. For Strategy<br>
        open each combat with a use of Flurry of Blows, setting up analyze on each of your enemies. This gives you free reaction attacks against your enemies and gives your team a better idea of what damage types to use. Mind of Mercury pairs very well with the reaction attacks of Extract Aspects. Debilitating Barrage is best when discussed with your allies, preparing a very high burst of damage with a single type. 
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Paladin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Oathbreaker(DMG)</li>
    <p>
        Oathbreakers were presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide as an option for evil characters or to inspire villains for a DM. However, I reject the idea that any class or subclass should be tied to a specific moral standpoint<br>
        so you should discuss with your DM the option of playing one of these characters if you are interested. These are Paladins who, for one reason or another, broke their sworn Oath. With this deep breach of character, they have been<br>
        physically and magically altered. However, the breaking of this Oath can be for good, the best example being if you swore an Oath to a ruler or order you later found out to be committing atrocities. Breaking your Oath is then morally upstanding. You now lead legions of undead, I recommend putting effort into forming a small militia of undead soldiers to really feel your abilities.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of the Crown(SCAG)</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of the Crown hold a similar role to Banneret Fighters, being heavily inspired by tales of classic knights. These Paladins' Oath is to the concept of civilization, to the power of a ruler, and/or the ideals of a nation.<br>
        These Paladins serve the laws and order of their chosen sovereign, working to uphold the glorious order and standing against the uncivilized chaos of the world outside. For Strategy, you will use your Channel Divinity for Champion Challenge<br>
        much more often than Turn the Tide. A widespread heal is good if your party all get near death at once, but in every other scenario Champion Challenge allowing you to keep in range of enemies that want distance and keep melee enemies away from your ranged allies is much better.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of the Open Sea(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of the Open Sea find the beauty of life in the vast freedom of the oceans, seeking thrilling lives unrestricted by land dwelling ideals. These Paladins are especially known for their work at freedom fighters, seeking out<br>
        tyrants and corruption for the sake of giving others a life lived free. Your Channel Divinity has two very unique uses, each excellent for serving its purpose. While there tends to be more nuance to it, the fundamental idea of which to use<br>
        is Marine Layer if your party is taking a defensive strategy through combat and Fury of the Tides if you're fighting aggressively. Similar to Juggernaut Barbarian, these Paladins are excellent at keeping enemies dispersed around the battlefield, allowing your team to take the combat in smaller pieces. 
    </p>

<h3>Ranger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Drakewarden(FTD)</li>
    <p>
        A Drakewardens connection to the wilds manifests as a wild spirit, but unlike Swarmkeeper, this spirit takes a physical form as a Drake companion. You and this Drake become more and more reminiscent of the ancient dragons this subclass<br>
        draws their magic from. If you are looking for Beast Master, but with some more flavor and a more reliable companion, this is for you. The first tip, remember your Drakes Infused Strikes reaction. This is a reactive way to add some elemental<br>
        damage to an attack, and keep in mind that it takes the Drakes reaction, not yours, and can be used on any hit, not just yours. Finally, this subclass can later take advantage of mounted combat, eventually even flying on your Drake, so take some time to learn how mounted combat works.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Lunar Sorcery(DSDQ)</li>
    <p>
        As a Lunar Sorcerer, you or an ancestor have been exposed to the pure magical light of your moon or moons. This could be from some druidic ritual involving the moon, or you came in contact with a piece of the moon that crashed onto the world.<br>
        Due to this, you have heavy connections to the lunar cycles, and your magic reflects moonlight in your eyes. This subclass is very adaptable, especially once you get Waxing and Waning. With this, you can consistently alter your playstyle to whatever your party needs.<br>
        Taking a wide array of spells from different schools of magic will support this adaptability and help you get more use from Lunar Boons. Changing your Lunar Embodiment also makes it harder for enemies to plan around your effects, especially with how different some of them are, this confusion can win you a fight.
    </p>
    <li>Runechild(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Magic is often an intimidating tool, frightening many unable to wield it, and harming many who thought they could. Sorcerers have a birthright connected to this power, and some Sorcerers unwittingly manifest this magic on their physical form.<br>
        These Sorcerers are called Runechildren, and their existence fascinates scholars who believe the runes on their bodies detail unknown secrets to the nature of magic. This subclass poses a very unique flow, especially for Sorcerers. The fundamental<br>
        idea of this subclass is taking advantage of spending Sorcery Points, to gain another expendable resource. It can be worth taking some time in between combat to convert some Sorcery Points into Charged Runes as a bonus action, primarily because using that bonus action has twice as much rune gain. You have a ton of things you can spend your runes on but don't get greedy. Saving some for Sigilic Augmentation can be a lifesaver.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Warlock</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Undead(VRGR)</li>
    <p>
        Your Patron is a being that has become disconnected from the ideas of life and death, separating themselves from this supposedly inevitable cycle. They surrender their mortality and humanity to become untouched by time, allowing them<br>
        to create and enact century-long plans, of which you are now a part. For being a piece in their schemes, they share with you the secrets of their ambition, bringing you closer to forsaking mortality yourself. Try to have Form of Dread<br>
        active whenever you're in combat, as it should have enough uses and synergizes with most of your abilities. This is a more aggressive subclass, having a few abilities that only work when you hit enemies. Additionally, due to Spirit Projection, your spell list should contain a comfortable amount of Necromancy and Conjuration spells.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Chronurgy Magic(EGW)</li>
    <p>
        These Wizards have done what many believed to be unthinkable - harnessed the power of time itself. Using magic prowess, they can alter the flow of time for themselves and others, even able to freeze spells in time. As fluent as a musician<br>
        playing an instrument these Wizards can bend the world in the blink of an eye. You gain many abilities to influence the dice rolls of your allies and opponents, which is extremely powerful in a game of luck like D&D. Use Arcane Abeyance<br>
        in ways like giving a spell with a range of touch to a melee fighter, so they can get it off without you being in danger, or to give a self-only spell to someone who couldn't normally cast it. Finally, Convergent Future is amazing, essentially being able to choose the outcome of dice rolls. However, it has the most detrimental downside possible, Exhaustion. Exhaustion is very punishing and very dangerous, so be careful.
    </p>
    <li>Graviturgy Magic(EGW)</li>
    <p>
        These Wizards tap into a force that seems both natural and magical, an innate practice of the universe that gives many physical properties to what we understand, gravity. Mastering forces to pull apart and separate matter, these Wizards<br>
        can perform acts that seem divine to the untrained eye. While this subclass does not seem all that inherently powerful, especially compared to its sibling Chronurgy, it provides a fun playstyle you won't find in other Wizards. Your Adjust Density<br>
        feature can be used to help an ally get into position or make a mobile enemy more manageable. For the saving throws, the main use you'll find is the disadvantage on Strength to be put against your graviturgy spells. 
    </p>
    <li>Blood Magic(TCSR)</li>
    <p>
        Wizards at times can be known for forsaking ethics and common courtesy in the pursuit of magical knowledge and power. A most notable example of this are practicers of Hemocraft, or blood magic. These Wizards realize there is latent arcane energy<br>
        within the blood of creatures, harnessing this latent magic to further their techniques. These Wizards, more than anything, should be built with a very good Constitution score. Additionally, you should discuss with your party that to get<br>
        the full use of your College, you will need some very reliable healing from your allies. As long as you have this healing, however, you can largely ignore the material costs of spells and maintain very consistent damage with your spells through Sanguine Burst.
