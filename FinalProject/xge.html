<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Path of the Ancestral Guardian</li>
    <p>
        An Ancestral Guardian draws power from their ancestors, most commonly in honor of a clan's heritage. These Barbarians believe that the spirits of mighty warriors remain in the world<br>
        and they call on these spirits to bolster their ranks and defenses. Ancestral Guardians play a somewhat unique role among the Barbarian Paths as it's built almost entirely around defense.<br>
        Keeping your Ancestral Protectors active as much as possible is the way to go, which is easy because you just have to hit an enemy. Beyond that, watch for which enemy is affected by it, the best bet being to put it on a high-damage dealer. Finally, use Spirit Shield as much as possible, generally only using a different reaction if it will get a kill.
    </p>
    <li>Path of the Storm Herald</li>
    <p>
        Storm Heralds draw their rage from the primordial elements, bringing forth swirling flames, frost, and lightning. These Barbarians often fight with the natural world, allying with Druids and Rangers.<br>
        With this subclass, you are presented with 3 choices for a Storm Aura. With any of these kinds of decisions, pick which seems the most enjoyable. Keep in mind that, one, you can change this decision whenever you gain a level<br>
        and two, most of your abilities after Storm Aura have an effect that depends on your chosen option. If you have trouble deciding, Tundra tends to be the most reliable option. A passive temporary hp aura is very nice for keeping allies topped up and the slow later helps lock down melee enemies. For damage, I prefer Sea for the targeted damage and prone.
    </p>
    <li>Path of the Zealot</li>
    <p>
        Zealots are fueled by divine rage, being fierce champions of a god or deity. These Barbarians typically spend their lives amidst nigh endless carnage for the divine they serve.<br>
        This endless fight is reflected in both their Warrior of the Gods and Rage Beyond Death abilities, which allow a Zealot to treat death as impermanent. The rest of the abilities are<br>
        what you'd expect from a Barbarian, which is not to say they are bad. Divine Fury is constant extra damage, Fanatical Focus is protection against a saving throw, and Zealous Presence is a very nice party-wide buff. I will recommend, for Divine Fury, choosing Radiant over Necrotic. Unless you have character reasons for Necrotic, Radiant works much more often.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Bard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>College of Glamour</li>
    <p>
        Glamour Bards learned their art from a fey teacher, an ancient elf, or perhaps spent time studying in the Feywild, the realm of the fey. The performances of these Bards have a uniquely strong<br>
        ability to delight and captivate their audience, with every ounce laced with magic. This magic, when wielded by heroes, inspires and emboldens those affected, while tearing the arrogance from oppressors.<br>
        This is a very fun subclass, that is loaded with synergy. The biggest tips I can give are to try and open up fights with your Mantle of Inspiration. This helps your party begin in good positioning and adds some first-round protection. And to charm constantly, through whatever source you can find. It fits the subclass and works in tandem with most of your abilities.
    </p>
    <li>College of Swords</li>
    <p>
        Where Valor Bards seek tales of heroes to tell, Sword Bards - or Blades - blend their mastery of an art with mastery of weapons and work to create their own stories with feats of prowess.<br>
        Blades play similarly to a cross between Bards and Battle Master Fighters, which means you'll need to put some effort into managing when to spend your Inspiration for traditional uses and when to spend it on Flourishes.<br>
        To lean heavily into using your weaponry, I recommend taking a good few spells that either use a bonus action or have a lasting effect that allows you to use your action for something else while it's happening. 
    </p>
    <li>College of Whispers</li>
    <p>
        Whisper Bards are very secretive of their nature, rarely letting on that they are of the College of Whispers due to the general distrust harbored against them. This is because these Bards<br>
        deal in secrets, blackmail, and exploitation. While these are often less than moral tactics, there is no reason they can't be used for good. Your Words of Terror and Mantle of Whispers are<br>
        very interesting features, though they may not seem very useful on their own. They are excellent for infiltration and information gathering, proving especially useful in high-population areas. To top it off, I recommend leaning into the playstyle with plenty of Illusion spells.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Cleric</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Forge Domain</li>
    <p>
        A Forge Cleric draws divine power from a god of the forge, often working as or supporting a smith. They venture out to protect the gathering of resources for a forge and are the most likely of the Clerics to deal<br>
        in magic items, whether that's retrieving or forging them. With this blacksmith heritage in mind, it is extremely uncommon to find a Forge Cleric not wreathed in heavy armor. Due to the heavy armor<br>
        and the enhancements you get for weapons and armor, a Forge Cleric can get value from being up in the fight, trading blows, and throwing in the odd fire-themed spell.
    </p>
    <li>Grave Domain</li>
    <p>
        A Grave Cleric believes in the importance of death and peace after life. They believe that death is a beautiful inevitability and fight to put undead to rest and ease the suffering of the dying.<br>
        While it may seem odd, these Clerics are also very good at preventing allies from dying. This follows the idea that it isn't quite someone's time, or they are needed for something more. Following this<br>
        I recommend building these Clerics into support, playing into healing spells and keeping your allies from harm. Path to the Grave is also a fantastic setup for when you or an ally are about to hit a dangerous enemy with a powerful attack.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Druid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Circle of Dreams</li>
    <p>
        Dream Druids draw their magic from land heavily influenced by fey magic, causing them to frequently work with good-aligned fey. They seek to bring wonder to the world, making it a place of gentle<br>
        rest for the weak. These are very supportive Druids, with each of their abilities designed to help your party in some way. Balm of the Summer Court is a great source of burst healing and the temporary hp<br>
        encourages you to use it in bigger bursts. I recommend waiting to use much of it until you can use multiple dice at a time. Don't forget Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow, it's a very good defense for a rest, which is uncommon. As a DM, I can assure you plenty can happen when you're asleep.
    </p>
    <li>Circle of the Shepherd</li>
    <p>
        Shepherd Druids work in tandem with the spirits of nature, most frequently those of beasts and fey. These Druids see the importance of every life and work to protect creatures that have trouble defending themselves.<br>
        Fighting off poachers and safeguarding habitats of at-risk creatures are common activities among these Druids. The Circle reflects this by benefiting summons you perform and allowing you to bring forth a totem spirit.<br>
        For your Totem Spirit, you choose a new option each time you use it, so you can call a new one as it's called for or theme your character around a specific one. Because of the buffs to summons, I recommend taking plenty of spells that do just that, especially if they summon a beast or fey.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Fighter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Arcane Archer</li>
    <p>
        Arcane Archers mix a study of ancient magic with a mastery of the bow and are also the only Fighter subclass dedicated to ranged fighting. Arcane Archery began as a practice exclusive to Elven soldiers<br>
        trained in this technique to guard their settlements from a safe distance. The signature ability of Arcane Archers is the Arcane Shot, which is similar in concept to Battle Master Maneuvers.<br>
        When selecting these, of course, choose which seem most fun. If you struggle choosing, a couple of my personal choices are Enfeebling Arrow and Shadow Arrow.
    </p>
    <li>Cavalier</li>
    <p>
        Cavaliers are experts at mounted combat, learning how to be as effective as possible while atop some sort of noble steed. Due to the nature of training and prestige required by a Cavalier, most come from a noble heritage.<br>
        Cavalier is an extremely unique subclass, as it uses mounted combat rules, which alone is a relatively obscure ruling. On top of that, it's the only subclass that even dabbles in mounted combat.<br>
        You may notice, however, that only one of its abilities actually mentions a mount. Regardless, it is a very solid subclass, with a good mix of offensive and defensive abilities that are all interesting to use.
    </p>
    <li>Samurai</li>
    <p>
        Samurai are warriors who display a remarkable fighting spirit, able to stand stalwart against unwavering odds and fight to the last breath. Consistency is very important in a game like D&D, which is why Advantage is so useful.<br>
        With this in mind, Fighting Spirit is a great way to keep yourself reliably dealing damage, and the temporary hp displays the resolve of this subclass in a flavorful way while allowing you to take duels more effectively.<br>
        Elegant Courtier is a very neat example of encouraging Fighters to use a mental score, in this case, Wisdom, and provides some out-of-combat utility, which is desirable for Fighters. And you may see the innate synergy between Fighting Spirit and Rapid Strike. Even without Fighting Spirit, finding ways to get advantage can lead to very nice damage increases from Rapid Strike.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Way of the Drunken Master</li>
    <p>
        Drunken Master Monks develop a fighting style inspired by the unsteady swaying movements of a drunkard. They often pose as oafs, or just somewhat inept people, as a display of humility, but also to conceal their skill.<br>
        They enjoy taking combat with the arrogant or aggressive and humiliating them with seemingly random movements. These Monks are highly mobile, and you should keep that to your advantage. Constantly shifting around the terrain<br>
        can break enemy formations and make you harder to hit. Especially with Drunken Technique and Intoxicated Frenzy, you should work to cover distance and hit as many enemies as you can.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Kensei</li>
    <p>
        Kensei Monks train ruthlessly to perfectly hone their technique with a weapon or weapons of choice. These weapons become ingrained in their identity and way of life, and Kensei use these weapons as an artist would use a brush.<br>
        These Monks are dedicated whole-heartedly to their practice and demonstrate the beauty of martial arts through this technique. There is no wrong answer when choosing your Kensei weapons, as long as they meet the requirements.<br>
        Longsword and Longbow are classic choices, and they work great, but many other combinations are just as effective. These Monks tend to rely the least on unarmed strikes, as you'll get more benefit from attacking with your weapons. Keep in mind, however, that Agile Parry requires you to hit with an unarmed strike so be sure to weave them in at times.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Sun Soul</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Sun Soul channel their Ki as a brilliant display of radiant energy. They follow the belief that every soul harbors this blazing light of ki and all can tap into it through meditation.<br>
        For the most part, you should be using your Radiant Sun Bolt as your primary attack, as it will be on par with your unarmed strikes, but from range and dealing radiant damage. With that in mind, it can be nice to weave in unarmed strikes<br>
        if you need to use an ability that requires them. Lastly, these abilities can be very ki point intensive, requiring you to spend a lot of them at times. For Sun Soul especially, it's smart to keep an eye on your ki points and use them wisely.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Paladin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Oath of Conquest</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of Conquest swear an Oath to the principles of war, domination, and subjugation. Survival of the fittest and strength above all are very common philosophies for these warriors. They value structure<br>
        and order, especially that brought on by judicious bloodshed. To meet these concepts, a Conquest Paladin should fight deep in enemy lines, trading blows and taking lives. Conquering Presence is best used when opening a fight surrounded by enemies or trying to end a fight while surrounded.<br>
        Guided Strike is best used when you've rolled so low you know you will not hit on an important attack, such as one to kill an enemy who's about to kill an ally. Aura of Conquest can be very powerful, so try to find more ways to frighten enemies to get the full value from it.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of Redemption</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of Redemption are the epitome of mercy, being trained with the discipline of using violence only as a last resort. These Paladins believe that evil is not a permanent state, and all can live a life of benevolence.<br>
        These Paladins will resort to violence but only when it is the only way to save innocent lives or when it is painfully clear an enemy is beyond redeeming. With this in mind, try to take spells that defend your party<br>
        or restrict enemies rather than harm them. To fully delve into the character, attempt conversing with enemies when you first enter combat, only engaging if they refuse to see reason. Your Aura of the Guardian is a fantastic ability, allowing you to remove damage from allies squishier than you. Just don't overdo it, it's fine for allies to take some hits if it means you stay alive.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Gloom Stalker</li>
    <p>
        Gloom Stalkers are masters of lurking in dark damp places. Trading the natural fear of the dark for finding comfort in the quiet, these Rangers master combat under low light conditions and venture into<br>
        otherwise uncivilized places to slay beasts others couldn't find. You want to put points into Wisdom and Dexterity to wield the full breadth of Gloom Stalker. Dread Ambusher is a very powerful ability<br>
        giving you benefits to arguably the 3 most important things. Improved initiative, move speed, and an extra attack on the first round of combat often allow you to get rid of an enemy or prepare to get rid of a more threatening one. Wisdom is helpful for this and your spells, Dexterity is helpful because this subclass benefits a lot from Stealth and ranged or finesse weapons.
    </p>
    <li>Horizon Walker</li>
    <p>
        Horizon Walkers are guardians of the Material Plane, the plane in which most humanoids reside, spending their lives exploring the boundaries between planes. They become experts at dealing with otherworldly magic<br>
        befriending forces on other planes like good fey and dragons, and watching over portals. As is common for Rangers, you likely want to put points into Wisdom and Dexterity. Wisdom being primarily for your spells<br>
        but it's also a relatively common saving throw, and Dexterity for your weaponry, some useful skills, and another common saving throw. These Rangers can be equally efficient with either a melee or ranged weapon, the best tip I can give is that regardless of your weaponry, try to use your teleports to end your turn away from melee enemies and right next to ranged enemies. Unless those ranged enemies also have melee or powerful spells.
    </p>
    <li>Monster Slayer</li>
    <p>
        Monster Slayers are very classic fantasy hunters, they train to be experts at taking out mystical beasts like dragons, vampires, and demons. They hone their form, physical and mental to resist the magical nature<br>
        of their foes. This is reflected very nicely in their abilities, as they get many ways to understand and overcome any unnatural feats of their enemies. For starters, Wisdom is still very helpful, being for spells and for Hunter's Sense.<br>
        With this Ranger, you can make good use of either Strength or Dexterity weapons, that is up to you. Hunter's Sense is an invaluable tool, best used as early in a combat as possible to tell you and your party how you should and shouldn't fight an enemy. Lastly, have constant uptime on your Slayer's Prey, prioritizing enemies that force saving throws frequently.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Rogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Inquisitive</li>
    <p>
        Inquisitive Rogues are investigators, perfecting their process and deduction and observation. These Rogues masterfully reveal hidden plots lying in cities or reveal cloaked enemies hiding among the common folk.<br>
        Bringing evil to light and a deep understanding of the nuances of humanoid life are trademark qualities of these Rogues. You want to use Dexterity-based weapons for Sneak Attack, and you want good modifiers for Perception, Insight, and Investigation.<br>
        This can be done through good Wisdom and Intelligence, through expertise, or ideally both. This is to make full use of Ear for Deceit, Eye for Detail, and Steady Eye, which are excellent tools for information gathering and making sure enemies do not get the drop on your party. Finally, use your early turns in combat to use Insightful Fighting on a dangerous target, especially if they're more evasive and will be hard to get a regular Sneak Attack on.
    </p>
    <li>Mastermind</li>
    <p>
        Rogue Masterminds know people, they fully grasp how intricate each communication is, using words like weapons to exploit those you face, and hoarding secrets like treasure. Outside of combat, these Rogues are especially good at wreaking societal and economic havoc.<br>
        Due to the mastery of words, you should build these Rogues with high points in Charisma, using Deception, Persuasion, and your disguise kit to make dealing with non-combative people an ease. Use your skills to<br>
        cheat your way into places of power and knowledge, acting as a spy to gather information and make connections. In my experience, the help action is used rarely, but not because it's ineffective. Being able to use it as a bonus action with Master of Tactics allows you to give a melee ally an edge in combat, while you use them being near the enemy to perform your Sneak Attacks.
    </p>
    <li>Scout</li>
    <p>
        Scouts are the least urban of the Rogues. Whereas most feel at home within a city's Thieves Guild and harbor a wealth of tactics for use in or around buildings, Scouts put their skills to work outside city walls.<br>
        These Rogues learn to maneuver in the outdoors, staying mobile around a battlefield, taking in their environment, and using it to pressure their enemies. These Rogues are the perfect example of how good a Rogue can be at scouting for a party, which obviously fits very well.<br>
        I recommend moving ahead of your party, creeping from shadow to shadow on the look for danger to then report to your party and engage. It's preferable to use ranged weapons, to get the full effect of your evasiveness and ambush capabilities. Make sure you are looking for ways to get advantage against enemies, as Scouts do not get an alternate way to perform Sneak Attack, so some extra effort needs to be applied there.
    </p>
    <li>Swashbuckler</li>
    <p>
        Swashbucklers have beautifully blended a mastery of the blade with a graceful and charming style of fighting, often resulting in a very charismatic duelist dead-set on humiliating an enemy and remaining untouched.<br>
        Swashbuckler is very fun, allowing you to dash in, taunt and maim an enemy, and dash away unharmed. To properly wield this, the first step is a high score for Dexterity and Charisma. Dexterity for your weapons, initiative, and helpful skills.<br>
        Charisma for Rakish Audacity and Panache, both excellent abilities. It may take time to get the rhythm of Swashbuckler down but it's very rewarding when you do. Run up to a lone enemy, try to open combat with Panache, then repeatedly use Sneak Attack with Rakish Audacity and Fancy Footwork to hit the target and maneuver away. The risk is you may take some hits, so having good Constitution can also be useful.
    </p>

<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Divine Soul</li>
    <p>
        Divine Souls pull their innate magic from a spark of celestial light deep in their spirit. There may be a celestial somewhere in your ancestry, or perhaps your birth aligned with some holy prophecy. Either way<br>
        you can call upon righteous magic to bolster your allies and fend off threats. When building this character, you are tasked with choosing the affinity of your magic. This refers to what alignment or belief system lies behind your source of magic.<br>
        This is a great way to help come up with roleplay and flavor for your character. As for the build itself, you can take this character in many directions, whatever seems the most fun when drawing between Cleric and Sorcerer as Divine Souls do. I will say, take a few good sources of healing, to make sure your Empowered Healing is relevant.
    </p>
    <li>Shadow Magic</li>
    <p>
        Shadow Sorcerers draw their magic from some innate connection to the Shadowfell. The Shadowfell is a plane that feasts off of negative emotion, full of decay and death, bleak and barren. The most common source of this magic<br>
        is being from a lineage of Shadar-kai, the elves of the Shadowfell, or you were tainted by its energy in some way. A pretty versatile subclass, which is common for Sorcerers, there isn't really a right or wrong build.<br>
        The best tip I can give is to use your Hound of Ill Omens either to harass casters or other ranged characters your party has trouble getting to. Or, if you need to spam spells on one tough enemy, put your hound on them for the disadvantage against your saves.
    </p>
    <li>Storm Sorcery</li>
    <p>
        Storm Sorcerers are masters of magic revolving around elemental air, expressing control over air, lightning, thunder, and the seas. This magic commonly festers from being born during some monumental storm that ravaged your home, leaving a spark of magic in you.<br>
        Outside of adventuring parties, these Sorcerers are employed frequently by ships and ports to help report and dampen incoming storms. To fit this concept and to get full use of your abilities, I recommend taking plenty of spells that deal lightning or thunder damage.<br>
        Spells like Chromatic Orb or Shatter fit this very well. Additionally, because of the area of effect of Heart of the Storm, it's beneficial to get up close to at least a couple enemies when you cast a spell. Now, this would be risky, especially due to the low health of a Sorcerer, but you can use Tempestuous Magic immediately after the spell to move back to a safe position. Then repeat.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Warlock</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Celestial</li>
    <p>
        Your magic comes from a pact with a being of the Upper Planes, some form of celestial. This powerful being has permitted you the faintest hint of the brilliant light that guides the world allowing you to draw power from it.<br>
        This pact often subconsciously changes a person, leading them to desire seeking out and destroying the unholy, working to support temples, and daydreaming of their patron's home in the Upper Planes. To build one of these Warlocks<br>
        prioritize spells that deal fire or radiant damage, as they get buffed by Radiant Soul. Because of your healing, temporary hp, eventual resurrection ability, and choice of Pact of the Blade, these Warlocks can work very well as a blend of caster and melee.
    </p>
    <li>The Hexblade</li>
    <p>
        Hexblades form a pact with a mysterious entity of the Shadowfell, a plane of barren death and decay. The being this pact is formed with is known for creating sentient magical weapons, sent out to bond with adventurers and work to achieve the patron's goals.<br>
        Hexblades summon weapons to emulate these, often vying to prove themself to their patron. While I prefer to encourage variety when crafting builds, because of the way Hexblade works, it is practically mandatory that it is built to be a melee fighter, taking Pact of the Blade.<br>
        You will find the most efficiency using spells to buff yourself, hinder enemies, or as a last resort. Having higher points in Constitution is recommended due to this playstyle, and due to Hex Warrior, you don't need to worry about having good Strength or Dexterity.<br>
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>War Magic</li>
    <p>
        War Mages abandon the traditional training inspired by schools of magic and instead hone their magic and wit for war. These Wizards spend equal time studying the battlefield as they do magic and bring defensive and offensive magic together.<br>
        They act quickly and efficiently in a fight, thinking through and executing possible strategies. For tips, to start, don't be afraid to use Arcane Deflection as much as you need. While there is a downside, cantrips tend to have perfectly acceptable damage and effects<br>
        especially if it means you'll be alive to use them. Also, remember to take advantage of Power Surge, which means being sure to take Dispel Magic and Counterspell. These are already two very helpful spells and being able to deal more damage by using them shouldn't be passed up.
