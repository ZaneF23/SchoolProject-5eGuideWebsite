<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Path of the Berserker</li>
    <p>
        A Berserker heavily resembles your traditional viking style character. A very straightforward Path, it offers additional damage opportunities and some conditional defense.<br>
        Not a lot of effort needs to go into building a Berserker, as with any Barbarian put your highest points into Strength and Constitution and hit things with the weapon of your choice.<br>
        Also be sure to watch the exhaustion gained from your Frenzy. Exhaustion is an extremely harmful condition so you want to have ways around it before you Frenzy so much you get yourself killed.
    </p>
    <li>Path of the Totem Warrior</li>
    <p>
        A Totem Warrior chooses a spirit animal to guide and empower them. This Path offers a few subtypes, granting you different abilities depending on your selected spirit animal.<br>
        The important decision for a Totem Warrior is simply which spirit animal to choose. If you have trouble deciding, Bear Totem is the most popular for a reason. It provides the player with incredible damage resistance.<br>
        Alternatively, the Eagle Totem is a great choice for people looking to play a highly mobile Barbarian, as it allows you to Dash as a bonus action.

<h3>Bard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>College of Lore</li>
    <p>
        Lore Bards are the scholars of Bards; they spend their time learning ancient tales and cataloging information. They get abilities to disorient opponents with their words and tap into deeper knowledge.<br>
        Building a Lore Bard is more about the character than the stats. As is common with Bards, Charisma is the most important ability, outside that you want to put effort into making your character seem scholarly <br>
        whether that's in your roleplay or the skills you take proficiency in.
    </p>
    <li>College of Valor</li>
    <p>
        Valor Bards tell tales of great hero's and go out of their way to witness these stories as they occur. In a party, a Valor Bard inspires their allies to enhance their combat potential and improve their own.<br>
        Contrary to many other Bards, a Valor Bard should build into a more combative playstyle. While Charisma is still important, putting points into a damage score (Dexterity or Strength) and Constitution will help reach<br>
        this College's full potential.
    </p>

<h3>Cleric</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Knowledge Domain</li>
    <p>
        A Knowledge Cleric focuses their divine power on gathering information and using it for the benefit of themselves and others. This is a very support-oriented Cleric subclass that focuses on Divination and Enchantment<br>
        oriented abilities. To complement this, taking Enchantment or Divination spells, aside from the ones given by the Domain, will deepen your character's breadth of mental prowess. Putting points into Wisdom is always helpful as<br>
        a Cleric, and there is not much need for other stat spread.
    </p>
    <li>Life Domain</li>
    <p>
        The Life Cleric is the most heavily focused on healing option there is. Focusing their divine power on the rejuvenation and protection of life, their entire kit is based around healing your party.<br>
        With this in mind, take very high Wisdom to get the full power from your healing spells, take lots of healing spells, and focus your damage potential from summon spells. Fortunately, the spells given by your subclass follow this idea<br>
        as they give you a few very good healing and summon spells (Cure Wounds and Spiritual Weapon are exactly the kinds of spells you want).
    </p>
    <li>Light Domain</li>
    <p>
        Light Clerics are inspired by the purity of the sun and the revealing nature of light in all its forms. Seeking out darkness, whether physically or metaphorically, is a very common goal for Light Clerics.<br>
        These Clerics tend to be less supportive and take justice into their own hands. Taking spells that deal Fire or Radiant damage fits very nicely with this subclass and is improved by the level 17 ability.<br>
        The last tip is to remember your Warding Flare, do not waste it, but be sure to get value from it. The best time is against a dangerous attack. More specifically, an attack against an ally at low health, one that deals high damage, or one that has an additional effect.
    </p>
    <li>Nature Domain</li>
    <p>
        Nature Clerics, similar to Light Clerics, take a more aggressive role. They work to advance the goals of a Natural god, often by removing foreign enemies from a forest or ensuring a harvest goes smoothly. Their abilities focus on<br>
        taking control of the natural world, generally with spells that command or charm plants and animals. This subclass tends to be more thematic, not requiring a very specific build. What I can recommend is taking spells that seem to fit the forces<br>
        of nature and to be thoughtful about your Divine Strike. Unlike others, it can deal different damage types, so use that to get around any resistances you think an enemy may have.
    </p>
    <li>Tempest Domain</li>
    <p>
        Without discouraging you, I will begin by saying it takes a lot of effort to make a Tempest Cleric work. Not because the abilities are bad, but because they rely on dealing Lightning and Thunder damage. This is an issue because the only spells a Cleric gets<br>
        with that damage are 4 from this Domain. However, it can still be a very fun and powerful character. To get the most out of this subclass, I recommend taking a Feat like Magic Initiate to get some reliable low-level spells with Lightning or Thunder damage.<br>
        Some good options for this are Shocking Grasp and Lightning Lure for cantrips, and Witch Bolt or Chromatic Orb for your first level spell. Keep in mind that you will need either good Charisma or Intelligence to make this work.<br>
    </p>
    <li>Trickery Domain</li>
    <p>
        Trickery Clerics deal in subterfuge and disrupting false powers in the world. They can be built in various ways, sometimes a Robinhood-esque character, sometimes a freedom fighter. At their core, while they<br>
        could appear as evil-aligned characters, they work against oppression. Technically a support Cleric, you rarely want to engage in a direct fight. What I recommend is using Blessing of the Trickster to set up an ally<br>
        and Illusion and Enchantment spells to tamper with the battlefield and disrupt enemies.
    </p>
    <li>War Domain</li>
    <p>
        War Clerics are the most frontline a Cleric can get. They use their divine gifts to become exceptional warriors. Each of their abilities compliments their capacity to run straight towards enemies and hit them as much<br>
        as possible. To properly execute this, put points into Constitution and Strength while keeping Wisdom at a decent score. Your spell list is much less important than other Clerics', but you'll tend to get the most<br>
        benefit from summon or buff spells. Your damage output will come from yourself, not spells, so making yourself better able to deal damage, or adding another thing for your enemies to worry about helps the most.
    </p>

<h3>Druid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Circle of the Land</li>
    <p>
        Druids of the Land are the most versatile with raw spellcasting that a Druid can get. Rather than getting a bunch of fancy abilities, they get more spells, the ability to regain spell slots, and defensive abilities<br>
        to help them keep casting spells. The important decision for a Druid of the Land comes from which land you draw your spells. Each one has some different themes, and they can give a nice guide as to what other<br>
        spells you may want to take. My best advice for this is to see what the rest of your party can do and complement that with your spells. More importantly, choose whichever seems the most fun.
    </p>
    <li>Circle of the Moon</li>
    <p>
        Druids of the Moon perfect their use of Wild Shape. Essentially being the opposite of the Land Druids, Moon Druids use their spell casting only as a last resort. Instead, they focus on getting as much out of<br>
        their transformation as possible. They gain healing while transformed and transformation into stronger creatures. To get the most value out of this Druid, take spells that buff creatures, especially ones that last<br>
        a long time. Cast those before a combat, then in combat use your Wild Shape into something with high health and damage. Then, play like a Barbarian.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Fighter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Champion</li>
    <p>
        A Champion Fighter is someone who has worked to hone their physical self to perfection. Among Fighters, it's the most straightforward subclass, with all of its abilities being passive enhancements to things you will<br>
        already be doing as a Fighter. Because of this, it can be built in many ways. To get the most out of it, put points into Strength and Constitution, get a big weapon with heavy armor, and throw yourself at<br>
        enemies. For your two fighting styles, take Great Weapon Fighting and Defense. Finally, as with any Fighter, make sure to use your Action Surge early in combat against the toughest enemy, so no hits are wasted.
    </p>
    <li>Battle Master</li>
    <p>
        Battle Master Fighters have spent their lives studying the ways of war, learning more than just how to use a blade. They make an effort to understand the intricacies of a fight and fully utilize their advantages.<br>
        To build a Battle Master, take Constitution and your choice of Strength or Dexterity. When choosing your Maneuvers, until you have a good grasp of nuances of D&D combat, take whichever ones interest you the most.<br>
        When using them, be sure to use defensive ones against more dangerous attacks, and offensive ones when your whole party can take advantage of them. And do not forget Know Your Enemy, information like that can be vital.
    </p>
    <li>Eldritch Knight</li>
    <p>
        An Eldritch Knight Fighter is one that has dabbled in the arcane world, learning some Wizard spells with the goal of furthering their abilities beyond their physical being. At earlier levels, most of your spells<br>
        will be Abjuration or Evocation. While it seems discouraging to limit the school of your spells, many of the most beneficial and interesting spells for your character come from these schools and any after 7th level<br>
        can come from any school. The strategy with this Fighter comes in balancing your spells with your weapon attacks. Rely on melee more, saving spells for optimal moments. Use War Magic rather frequently to deal with enemies in irregular ways.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Way of the Open Hand</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Open Hand are the pinnacle of martial artists, perfecting their technique and using ki to change the flow of combat. Constitution and Wisdom are important scores for an Open Hand Monk as this allows them<br>
        to be up close in combat and get the most out of Ki abilities. Besides those, you want Strength or Dexterity to be high to get the most out of your many attacks. For strategy, use Open Hand Technique as often as your ki<br>
        points allow as it gives you a ton of battlefield control. Ideally, you want to be hitting two different targets with each use of Flurry of Blows. Knocking them prone is typically the best option, but situations can call for the others.
    </p>
    <li>Way of Shadow</li>
    <p>
        Monks of Shadow are your ninjas or assassins in the realm of Monks, getting enhancements to their stealth and mobility. With these Monks, you want to prioritize Dexterity over Strength, as Dexterity offers many skills<br>
        you want to use, such as Stealth. Taking time to scout out areas and understand where and who you will be fighting is very beneficial and easy for these Monks, as they can zip around an area obscured. Once you have an idea<br>
        of the fight you'll be taking, move in unseen and go for the most threatening enemy first. Use your abilities to stay highly mobile and pressure unexpecting enemies.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Four Elements</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Four Elements tie the powers of their ki to the elemental forces of nature. They exert their ki into the world to fuel elemental attacks and abilities. These Monks can reasonably use either Strength or Dexterity<br>
        and you will want to prioritize Wisdom as it's a vital skill to a lot of the Elemental Disciplines you use. When it comes to choosing your Disciplines, there are two routes to take. Either orient yourself around one element<br>
        theming it to your character or choose a variety of elements to get more damage types. This falls entirely to personal preference, but for sheer efficiency, having multiple damage types makes you reliable in more scenarios.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Paladin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Oath of Devotion</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of Devotion are your traditional knight in shining armor. Swearing to classic moral tenets like Honor, Duty, and Compassion, these warriors work to bring purity to the world, seeking out the helpless to protect and evil<br>
        to vanquish. Many of their abilities orient around keeping you and your allies safe from the unpure. Due to the limit of your Channel Divinity uses, I recommend that any Paladin use them very sparingly. Your Sacred Weapon is<br>
        best when you know you are about to get into a long combat. Your Turn the Unholy is best when surrounded by enemies that fit the typing.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of the Ancients</li>
    <p>
        An Oath of Ancients Paladin draws their Oath back to forgotten times and they fight in defense of the light and beauty of the world. The Tenets of the Ancients are that of bringing hope to the people and stopping others from taking that hope<br>
        They are the most devoted to nature of the Paladins and will often be seen bonding with strangers whether they be beast or humanoid. Their abilities are themed to nature and based around fighting through unnatural conditions. Use your Channel Divinity sparingly<br>
        Turn the Faithless if you're surrounded and Nature's Wrath is excellent for locking down either a highly mobile creature or a threatening enemy.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of Vengeance</li>
    <p>
        Oath of Vengeance Paladins are bringers of justice. Their Oath requires commitment, making these Paladins relentless hunters of a greater evil regardless of the cost. These Paladins tend to be intense in their quest, not accepting failure.<br>
        Despite this, they will always be willing to aid and serve those who have fallen harm to such an evil force. Your Abjure Enemy Channel Divinity should be used to lock down a threatening or annoying creature, saving it for after<br>
        you've dealt with another threat. Vow Of Enmity should be reserved for one-on-one duels with a tough opponent, to give you a needed edge. Other than that, your abilities perfectly demonstrate the relentless, hunting nature of your Oath.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hunter</li>
    <p>
        A Hunter Ranger acts as a guardian between civilization and the natural world. They venture out to take down whatever major threat is being posed to the civilians, perfecting their technique against specific varieties of threats.<br>
        For a Hunter Ranger, the classic longbow and light armor works great but you can also definitely get away with melee and medium armor. While all the different options can seem intimidating, there are simple ways to choose. For Hunter's Prey<br>
        whichever interests you most is fine, personally the extra raw damage from Colossus Slayer seems the most useful. From there out, it's a matter of knowing your environment. Keep in mind the combats you struggle in and take what assists those most.
    </p>
    <li>Beast Master</li>
    <p>
        Beast Master Ranger is an unfortunate victim of a few things. Poor design and bad circumstances. As you'll find with a lot of subclasses that rely on a summon, they aren't very good. And Beast Master is the worst of them. Put simply, it sucks.<br>
        But it doesn't have to. While this is straying away from the Players Handbook, I highly recommend checking out Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, as they did some newer work on Beast Master. Replacing the beast with a "Primal Companion" and changing<br>
        some rules for its Attacks opened it up to much more viability. For strategy, you either want to sit back with a ranged weapon and back up your tanky companion or charge in as a duo and tag team a single enemy.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Rogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Thief</li>
    <p>
        A Rogue Thief can present themself in a few ways. Some are just that: thieves, while others may be bandits, treasure hunters, or investigators. Regardless of background, these Rogues prove to be very good with their hands and incredibly agile.<br>
        These Rogues prove most useful deep in dungeons or in urban settings, where they can make full use of Fast Hands or Second-Story Work. To make use of Supreme Sneak and Thief's Reflexes, it can be smart to split from the party just a bit to scout<br>
        out an area and prepare an ambush. Use Magic Device is an incredibly unique feature, and while it does not provide much, it can lead to unexpected interactions both in gameplay and roleplay.
    </p>
    <li>Assassin</li>
    <p>
        Exactly as the name states, Assassin Rogues excel at giving an important target a swift and efficient death. These Rogues also favor an urban environment to make use of Infiltration Expertise and Impostor, which both serve to get the Rogue close<br>
        to an unsuspecting target. Making an effort to be high in initiative gives a lot of benefit to Assassins, as it lets them utilize Assassinate more freely. Keep in mind your Sneak Attack feature from Rogue will work with Assassinate as it grants Advantage.<br>
        Finally, something that I see drastically underused in general, and especially on Assassin Rogues, is the Poisoner's Kit. You get proficiency in it, and it rather easily lets you add some damage and/or effects to your attacks without a lot of effort.
    </p>
    <li>Arcane Trickster</li>
    <p>
        Arcane Trickster is the Rogue's venture into spellcasting. Similar to the Eldritch Knight Fighter, they get spells from the Wizard spell list and are generally limited by the school of magic. However, despite the limit to Illusion and Enchantment<br>
        Rogues are fantastic at getting the most out of those types of spells. While you lose out on some damage potential from spells, they are very helpful for setting up Sneak Attack, which has incredible damage potential. Outside of that, remember to<br>
        use your Mage Hand Legerdemain to interact with your environment. As with a lot of Rogue features, it's good to think outside the box.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Draconic Bloodline</li>
    <p>
        As a Draconic Sorcerer, the magic innate to you comes from a dragon. This could be that you yourself are the descendant of a dragon or perhaps one of your ancestors was blessed by a dragon to grant them magic. Due to how Draconic Sorcerers work<br>
        they break a general rule of casters. It is often beneficial to take spells with many different damage types to make yourself more efficient in different situations. However, it is very helpful for a Draconic Sorcerer to build their spell list<br>
        around the damage type chosen from their Ancestry. Aside from that, your damage resistance and health increase allows you to play much more frontline than other Sorcerers.
    </p>
    <li>Wild Magic</li>
    <p>
        Wild Magic Sorcerers are played for the fun of it. Due to the inherent randomness of the whole subclass, there is not really an inherent build. These Sorcerers get their power from the raw chaos at the foundation of reality. This power generally<br>
        comes from some kind of encounter with a primordial force, touching your soul with chaos. The abilities of a Wild Magic Sorcerer are based on causing and controlling chaos. At the base of it all is Wild Magic Surge, where you roll on a table<br>
        of random effects. These range from a full heal, to summoning useless allies, to casting Fireball at your own feet. Then, you get ways to control rolls, from yourself, enemies, or allies.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Warlock</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Archfey</li>
    <p>
        Warlocks of the Archfey get their power from a deal made with a very powerful fey. Fey are fantastical creatures, most commonly elvish in ancestry. Your patron could be some kind of faerie king or an ancient hag. You work to serve their goals and in turn<br>
        they grant you magic tied to the powers of the fey. This Patron can work well with both a frontline and backline Warlock. For a more aggressive character, you get plenty of defensive abilities in your Fey Presence and Misty Escape to help keep you in combat<br>
        despite a Warlock's lower health, and Pact of the Blade will be most of your damage. To focus more on casting, be evasive and use your abilities when something gets behind your frontline or to help hold concentration on a spell.
    </p>
    <li>The Fiend</li>
    <p>
        Warlocks of the Fiend get their power from a deal made with a very powerful fiend. Fiends are creatures from the Hells or the Abyss, devils or demons. This could be a god-like being such as an Archdevil or a Demon Lord, or a lesser fiend who has gained<br>
        enough power and influence to be a Patron. Regardless, they grant you fiendish magic to help further their goals. The abilities from this Patron are very versatile, allowing them to blend nicely with just about any character archetype. Similar to Archfey<br>
        you can easily get away with focusing on melee or spells. The one thing I would recommend is relying more on damage sources than disrupting enemies, as being aggressive will get you the most use of your Dark One's Blessing.
    </p>
    <li>The Great Old One</li>
    <p>
        Warlocks of the Great Old One get their power from a being incomprehensible to mortals. They are often gods from a foreign plane of existence or older than time. If you have any knowledge of Lovecraftian mythos, Cthulu would be one of these Patrons.<br>
        Fittingly, the abilities granted by this Patron are somewhat niche and they may require some effort to really get use from. Entropic Ward is straightforward and provides some nice protection. Because of its limit, save it for a dangerous attack<br>
        especially because it's your only defensive ability. I recommend building more around the casting of Warlock and taking Pact of the Tome. Play to disrupt enemies, tampering with their minds. Lastly, think outside the box, that's where your abilities will really shine.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>School of Abjuration</li>
    <p>
        Abjuration Wizards, or Abjurers, specialize in the most defensive of the schools. These Wizards are experts at protecting people physically and from unnatural effects. With any Wizard school, put effort into learning as many spells from this school as you can.<br>
        With the way your abilities and Abjuration spells work, you'll be playing a mostly supportive caster. Rather than healing though, you negate effects and damage, most famously through spells like Counterspell. A lot of strategy within this School stems from<br>
        knowing who to protect from what. For example, your Arcane Ward is an excellent defensive ability as it flatly negates damage and can be recharged easily. Because of the very low health of a Wizard, save Projected Ward for very dangerous attacks on allies.
    </p>
    <li>School of Conjuration</li>
    <p>
        Conjuration Wizards, or Conjurers, specialize in summoning magic, tapping into the fabric between planes. These Wizards produce objects and creatures seemingly from nothing as well as getting access to teleportation. With any Wizard School, put effort<br>
        into learning as many spells from this school as you can. With Conjuration spells and your abilities, you play a somewhat unique role. You may take more time to set up than other Wizards, but the benefit is gaining allies. Most of your damage will come<br>
        from summoning creatures to help you fight. Strategy comes into play when deciding which creatures to summon and when, and this comes with knowledge of your surroundings and enemies. Aside from that, make sure you're properly balancing concentration and non-concentration spells.
    </p>
    <li>School of Divination</li>
    <p>
        Divination Wizards, or Diviners, specialize in foresight, using magic to breach the walls of time and consciousness to know things others could not. With any Wizard School, put effort into learning as many spells of that school as you can. The biggest<br>
        tip to give is to not underestimate Portent. It is an incredibly powerful ability primarily because it gives a player control over the most dangerous aspect of the game - randomness. The difficulty of a Divination Wizard comes primarily from the way<br>
        Divination spells work. Their wording is often somewhat obscure and/or their purpose is not inherently evident. Using them in clever ways, and frequently once you have Expert Divination, will give you constant bits of knowledge you wouldn't have otherwise.
    </p>
    <li>School of Enchantment</li>
    <p>
        Enchantment Wizards, or Enchanters, specialize in influencing the minds of others. This can range from bringing the violent to peace or bending others to their will, though most characters fall in the middle. With any Wizard School, put effort into<br>
        learning as many spells of this school as you can. Taking a more supportive role, the job of Enchantment spells in general is to shut down enemies, whether it's by frightening, charming, or some other effect. With this in mind, target priority is very important.<br>
        Knowing what enemy needs to be shut down is the best thing to learn, as well as being aware of what enemies may be immune to being charmed. Your Hypnotic Gaze is a great way to test this playstyle, albeit a bit risky. Approach an enemy, lock them out of the fight, and go from there.
    </p>
    <li>School of Evocation</li>
    <p>
        Evocation Wizards, or Evokers, are the most classic of the Wizards as they specialize in raw elemental magic. Being by far the most aggressive Wizards, Evokers look to deal as much damage as possible through their magic. With any Wizard school<br>
        put effort into learning as many spells of that school as you can. As previously stated, dealing raw damage is the goal of an Evoker, which is reflected in all of their abilities. While it could seem a little plain, it makes up for it in the pure<br>
        fun of blasting enemies with Fireball or Lightning Bolt and rolling tons of dice. The main strategy comes from knowing who to hit with what, like where to place your areas of effect and which damage types to use when.
    </p>
    <li>School of Illusion</li>
    <p>
        Illusion Wizards, or Illusionists, specialize in the subtle magic of deception, making the impossible seem real and tampering with people's perception of the world. This school functions like a cross between Enchantment and Conjuration, as many<br>
        Illusion spells create things that aren't actually there with the intent of confusing or harming a person's mind. With any Wizard school, put effort into learning as many spells from this school as you can. For strategy, similar to Enchantment<br>
        use your Illusion spells to single out enemies, disrupting them. Illusion spells also have the goal of altering the battlefield, making false changes to the environment in your favor. Finally, be creative with the School abilities. They don't do much on their own, but there is tons of room for creativity.
    </p>
    <li>School of Necromancy</li>

        Necromancy Wizards, or Necromancers, specialize in the magic that surrounds the flow of life, death, and undeath. This magic taps into the very essence of a living creature, often draining that essence. At its peak, these Wizards are able to<br>
        manipulate the boundaries of life and death, bringing forth undead minions. Due to its seemingly corrupted nature, this magic is often seen as evil or taboo, but discussing it with your DM can lead to alternatives. With any Wizard school, put effort<br>
        into learning as many spells of this school as you can. For strategy, it plays similarly to a Conjuration Wizard, as your end goal is likely to have a small army. The difference, however, is that due to Necromancy often having life gain properties, you can join your minions in dealing damage.

    <li>School of Transmutation</li>
    <p>
        Transmutation Wizards, or Transmuters, specialize in magic that alters the form of energy and matter. With Transmutation, the form and function of the world is not a fixed concept, but rather something that can be adapted. With any Wizard school<br>
        put effort into learning as many spells of this school as you can. Because of the inherent nuance to Transmutation spells, getting full use of them requires similar out-of-the-box thinking to that of Illusion magic. Even if you don't think something<br>
        will work, try it and see what happens. Like Abjuration, you'll likely play a more defensively supportive role. A great example of this is your Transmuter's Stone. This ability is incredibly flexible and adapting it to each situation will help you grasp Transmutation.
