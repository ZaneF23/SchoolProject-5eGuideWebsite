<h3>Artificer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Alchemist</li>
    <p>
        Alchemists have tuned their expert craftsmanship towards brewing magical potions and elixirs. This craft is the oldest of Artificer trades, relying on ancient techniques and the versatility of nature.<br>
        If you're looking to build a supportive Artificer, these are likely your best option. Their elixir provides an array of helpful bonuses, that can be dispersed as your party needs them, you can brew potions for whatever you need<br>
        and you get plenty of options for healing and aid. For some tips, I recommend using your Alchemist's Supplies as your spellcasting focus, this is something only Artificers can do, and Alchemists get some enhancements for it. Try to keep your damage spells to the types listed in Alchemical Savant and talk with your DM about how you can get use from your Alchemist's Supplies.
    </p>
    <li>Armorer</li>
    <p>
        Armorers have tuned their expert craftsmanship towards modifying a suit of armor to act as defense, offense, and utility. This armor eventually becomes almost a second skin, being one with the Artificer.<br>
        Within Armorer are two rather distinct builds, aligning with the two options you have for your armor. First, Guardian armor turns your Artificer into a brawler, getting up close and personal with enemies. Remember that your armor removes any Strength requirements<br>
        and allows you to use Intelligence for the weapons, so you do not need to worry about having a very good physical score. Alternatively, there's Infiltrator, which is a more distanced mobile fighter that can be good for recon. With Infiltrator, you may want a comfortable Dexterity score, if you're interested in stealth. Finally, be sure you're infusing your armor, regardless of which you chose.
    </p>
    <li>Artillerist</li>
    <p>
        Artillerists have tuned their expert craftsmanship towards the creation of magical cannons and explosives. Highly valued during times of war, Artillerists are perfect for dealing with crowds of enemies and are known for getting carried away<br>
        by a love of explosions. At some point, many Artillerists who have experienced war turn their knowledge to fight against the resurgence of one, seeing the harm in their potential. The biggest I can give is a pretty obvious one<br>
        always have an Eldritch Cannon active. If you like the flavor of having one attached to your arm or something, go with that. However, having one able to move on its own tends to get more value, with controlled positioning and more target options. As for which you summon, that's all personal preference. Lastly, use your Arcane Firearm for all your spells once you have it.
    </p>
    <li>Battle Smith</li>
    <p>
        Battle Smiths have tuned their expert craftsmanship towards the creation of a Steel Defender, a constructed ally made to keep enemies away from your allies and assist you in combat. Similar to Artillerists, Battle Smiths<br>
        are often called upon in wartime, however, they are desired for their defensive expertise and medical capabilities. You'll want to make sure you take Mending and use an infusion to make your weapon magical. Mending is some backup healing for your Steel Defender<br>
        and having a magical weapon makes it so you can use Intelligence for it, reducing your stat spread. The two most common playstyles for this are to split up or stay together. Having either you or your Steel Defender stay back near your ranged allies and the other run in will keep your team safe and be offensive. Alternatively, you can both stay back or rush in if you need more defense or offense respectively.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Barbarian</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Path of the Beast</li>
    <P>
        Beastial Barbarians pull their rage from the primal beast that lies inside their soul, drawing forth physical transformation to echo this rage. Perhaps you're inhabited by the spirit of an ancient beast, or you're descended from shapeshifters.<br>
        In combat, these Barbarians appear feral, throwing grace and etiquette away for a raw kill-or-be-killed mentality. I recommend mimicking this, you'll get the most out of your abilities if you turn off your brain and throw caution to the wind.<br>
        For Form of the Beast, take whichever seems the most fun. if you're looking for advice, however, I recommend not using Bite unless you start combat at less than half health, and I prefer Claws over Tail for straight damage. Bestial Soul is entirely up to personal preference, choose which fits your environment the best. For Infectious Fury, it's often better to get a big enemy to hit smaller enemies. However, dealing more damage to your main target can be just as good or better, trust your judgement.
    </P>
    <li>Path of Wild Magic</li>
    <p>
        Wild Magic Barbarians draw their rage from pure magic-infused emotion, inspired or touched by the magic of some emotionally intense plane. Barbarians being people of deep feeling, any interaction with such a plane can dramatically alter them<br>
        granting new powers through their rage and an inherent connection to the chaos of magic. For strategy, be ready for any of the Wild Surge effects. They don't necessarily need to be planned around, but when combat begins start thinking of what you'd do with each one.<br>
        Things like good places to teleport to, what allies could really use an AC increase, and an enemy that should be blinded should be watched for. For Bolstering Magic, try to use only one or two before each fight, so you have some ready for if you need to engage again. Lastly, use Unstable Backlash frequently, as getting a new effect can help trigger things more often and disorient your enemies. Of course, do not use it if your current effect is especially helpful.
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Bard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>College of Creation</li>
    <p>
        Bards of Creation are devoted to the concept of the Song of Creation. This is the idea that the cosmos itself is a work of art, with its chorus echoing through every fiber of existence. This Song existed before the sun and moon, brought upon the first dawn<br>
        and is taught through oral tradition with dance, music, and poetry. Your Mote of Potential does not require any building around, it is an objective boost to your Bardic Inspiration with no extra steps. The rest of the abilities, however, take some creative thinking.<br>
        Use your Performance of Creation in odd ways. Creating items out of nothing can be very helpful but does nothing on its own. One very nice idea built into the subclass is to use Performance of Creation to make an item, and then use Animating Performance on that item.
    </p>
    <li>College of Eloquence</li>
    <p>
        Eloquence Bards are similar to philosophers, not inherently in their studies but rather in how they communicate. These Bards are expert wordsmiths, blending masterful use of logic with emotional wordplay.<br>
        Rather than playing an instrument, as is common amongst Bards, those from the College of Eloquence often prefer to use poetry or speeches. For Strategy, try to focus on spells that hinder your enemies, such as giving disadvantage.<br>
        This fits the theme and can be taken advantage of with Unsettling Words. You will also have to watch your uses of Bardic Inspiration. A lot of your abilities encourage you to use it, but you get two that help you get more out of each use of Bardic Inspiration. What I recommend is using Bardic Inspiration for its normal purpose most often and using Unsettling Words when an enemy seems very good against vital saving throws.
    </p>

<h3>Cleric</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Order Domain</li>
    <p>
        Order Clerics harbor complete devotion to the laws that govern their clergy, whether that be from a ruling power, a philosophical agreement, or something else. They believe that laws bring order and security.<br>
        Rulers are brought upon by laws, with a job to enforce said laws. For Strategy, take as many good Enchantment spells as you can find. Look for ones that buff allies and hinder enemies, you get bonuses to Enchantment spells<br>
        and these effects from two of your vital abilities. Use your Voice of Authority and enchant an ally that has high burst damage potential, such as a Rogue, Barbarian, or Paladin. Keep in mind to still put some effort into performing your own weapon attacks, especially once you have Embodiment of Law.
    </p>
    <li>Peace Domain</li>
    <p>
        Peace Clerics serve the idea of widespread harmony, believing peace is at the center of healthy communities and that kindness is a tool not to be underestimated. These Clerics are asked to watch over the delivery and signing<br>
        of treaties and arbitrate disputes. These Clerics draw people together and bolster those fighting for peace. If you are looking to play a pacifistic character, this is likely your best choice. Take a wide array of powerful supportive spells<br>
        and keep your party healthy and at full force. Use Emboldening Bond before each fight, or at the first turn if before isn't possible. Save Balm of Peace for when your party has all taken some notable damage to get the full value and try to encourage your party to stay within the effective range of your bond.
    </p>
    <li>Twilight Domain</li>
    <p>
        Twilight Clerics acknowledge the comfort of the day's end, resting off the hard labors and basking in the dusk light. But these Clerics' true devotion serves after dusk, as night falls and the fears of the dark encroach on people.<br>
        These Clerics step in to be the bastion between the people and these horrors, working to show that twilight too is a comfort. For strategy, make sure your Vigilant Blessing is always on an ally because there is no use limit or duration.<br>
        Be thoughtful about your uses of Twilight Sanctuary, as its effect can alter the course of a combat. If you begin a threatening combat or your opponents seem fond of inflicting charm or frighten are the best uses. 
    </p>
</ul>

<h3>Druid</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Circle of Spores</li>
    <p>
        Druids of Spores see the beauty in decay. They revere the power mold and fungi hold to transform the lifeless material into a form of life. They follow the idea that life and death is an endless, unavoidable cycle<br>
        saying death is not the end of life, but rather the next step. These Druids see nothing wrong with undeath, however undead that try to disrupt the cycle by refusing to die or making more undead fall against their ideals.<br>
        Some tips, use Symbiotic Entity as often as needed. This Circle cares little about Wild Shape for its traditional purpose, especially due to the synergy between Symbiotic Entity and your other abilities. Put Spreading Spores in high-traffic areas, to deal the most frequent damage with it, and use Zombies from your Fungal Infestation as fodder or meat shields.
    </p>
    <li>Circle of Stars</li>
    <p>
        Star Druids wield the power of starlight, coming from a very ancient Circle dedicated to watching over constellations and mapping their movements and meanings. By grasping these meanings, Star Druids seek to wield the powers of the cosmos.<br>
        Most of these Druids venture with some form of constellation map with them, and large groups of this Circle will mark their knowledge on massive stone monoliths. When playing this Druid, I recommend most uses of Wild Shape go towards your Starry Form.<br>
        While you probably shouldn't build to exclusively use one of the Starry Forms, keeping each in mind is a good idea. For example, make sure to have a few choices of healing spells, if your party needs them and you can make use of Chalice. Finally, remember to use Guidance constantly, it's incredibly useful and usually comes at no cost.
    </p>
    <li>Circle of Wildfire</li>
    <p>
        Wildfire Druids understand that for new life and ideas to form, the old must often be burned down. Putting to faith the idea that destruction is often a necessary precursor to creation, allowing them to bond with a form of primal spirit<br>
        that serves to create and destroy, birthing life and death. This is the only Druid Circle with any real access to fire spells, which can be alluring enough to some people by itself. Try to have consistent uptime on your Wildfire Spirit, at least in combat.<br>
        It adds an ally, and you eventually perform better just by having it exist and remember to use its teleport, not just its attack. The teleport can be nice for moving a group of allies around a battlefield or getting squishier teammates out of a swarm. Finally, do your best to corral enemies into your Cauterizing Flames and remind teammates you can heal anyone who steps into a space with one.
    </p>

<h3>Fighter</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Psi Warrior</li>
    <p>
        Psi Warriors have trained to reach outside mere physical strength and adapt to combat their foes with the power of psionics. Psionics is best described as an alternate form of magic, being dedicated to mental fortitude, prowess, and affecting the world with one's mind.<br>
        Training for this can come from sheer lone discipline or instinct or an institute designed to spread the power of psionics outside the world of magic. Because of the mental skill required by psionics, Psi Warrior requires Fighters to have a notable Intelligence score<br>
        which is used for many of their abilities. Due to this, I recommend having good Strength or Dexterity and good Intelligence, rather than good Strength and Dexterity as some Fighters may. Especially once you have Telekinetic Adept, using Psionic Strike over Protective Field will be overall more helpful as it is more instrumental to a fight. However, if an ally is getting focused by enemies, then use Protective Field. Lastly, keep in mind your movement abilities, as setting up an ally or reaching unreachable enemies can change an engagement.
    </p>
    <li>Rune Knight</li>
    <p>
        Rune Knights are Fighters who have studied the supernatural abilities of Giant runes, finding that they are drenched in ambient power. These Fighters most commonly learn their techniques directly from Giants or someone who regularly works with Giants.<br>
        You have practiced to instill this style of runic magic to empower your gear. This is a very versatile subclass, giving you a lot of passive out-of-combat assistance and helpful burst effects during combat. Some tips, when choosing runes, pay attention to both the passive<br>
        and the invoke. Try to take passives that will be relevant the most often for your character and party and look at invokes largely based on which seem the most fun. Every invoke is a very solid option, but if you need help choosing your early Runes, I prefer Stone and Cloud, and Storm at level 7. Of course, the subclass has more than just the runes, so remember Giant's Might for each combat and Runic Shield your allies, especially against critical hits.
    </p>
</ul>

<section>
<h3>Monk</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Way of Mercy</li>
    <p>
        Mercy Monks have learned the art of using ki to manipulate life forces and aid others. They enjoy traveling to remote places in need to assist those who can't care for themselves and use this manipulation of life forces<br>
        to give those beyond saving a swift merciful end. These Monks may be of a religious order, bringing aid with faith, small-town healers, or faceless bringers of final rest. For strategy, try to monitor the health of your allies, and which enemies have been hit the most.<br>
        Work to blend constant damage on pressured enemies with healing on pressured allies, having your teams' numbers go up and enemy numbers go down is the simplest path to victory. When using your Hands of Healing and Harm, try to use them through Flurry of Blows more often than not, as it gives you more benefit and allows you to conserve ki.
    </p>
    <li>Way of the Astral Self</li>
    <p>
        Monks of the Astral Self throw away the concept of a physical form, believing that the true nature of a person lies in their spirit or ki. Tapping into ki and manifesting it into a tangible form is the trademark of these Monks<br>
        who harbor a deep spiritual connection to the Astral Plane and the ki of living things. The first benefit of this subclass is the simpler stat spread. Because it allows you to use Wisdom for your weapons and Strength checks and saving throws<br>
        you can worry much less about physical scores, especially Strength. In addition, your Arms of Astral Self are objectively better unarmed strikes, so there is really no good reason to attack with anything else. Finally, more for flavor, keep in mind that your Astral Self does not have to look like your character, and can instead reflect background, goals, emotions, and trauma.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Paladin</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Oath of Glory</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of Glory believe that true success and the grand purpose of life are to have your tales sung for ages to come. They believe they and their allies are destined for greatness, that their accomplishments and quests will<br>
        change the world. Face your doubts and troubles with courage and the discipline not to dwell on your failures, so as to not taint the glory of your legacy. This subclass encourages your party to stay tightly knit or at least for you and another tankier ally to.<br>
        Use your Aura of Alacrity for you and any melee allies to run headlong into combat on their first turns. For your Channel Divinity, you will end up using Inspiring Smite much more often than Peerless Athlete, as it's often just more helpful. While it can be nice to try and evenly divide it amongst allies, it tends to be more effective when you stack it on squishier allies, or a melee fighter being focused by enemies.
    </p>
    <li>Oath of the Watchers</li>
    <p>
        Paladins of the Watchers swear their Oath to defend the mortal realms from unnatural and extraplanar threats as common folk are entirely unprepared for the dangers posed by these creatures from beyond. To perform this, Watchers much<br>
        hone not only their combat skills but also their mind and spirit, to stand against the supernatural effects of their enemies. These Paladins often go to the extent of constant suspicion and networks of spies to keep eyes out for extraplanar threats.<br>
        Knowing this, it is wholly unsurprising to discover their kit works very well against most of the less natural enemies. Because of the importance of saving throws, and the fact that the turned condition ends on taking damage, your Channel Divinity will be better spent on Watcher's Will.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Ranger</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fey Wanderer</li>
    <p>
        Fey Wanderers have become infused with fey magic and influence at some point in their lives. Maybe born there, maybe blessed or touched by an archfey, maybe they ate one too many magic berries. However it happens, you now flitter through<br>
        the Material Plane and Feywild using your charming presence to encourage friends and martial talent to frighten foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury. These Rangers prove versatile, being more of a favorfully themed subclass<br>
        than a mechanically themed subclass. Your Beguiling Twist is fantastic, and a lot of fun, as charmed and frightened are two extremely common conditions that you can prevent and redirect. Remember that Dreadful Strikes takes no kind of action, so you can pair it with something like Hunter's Mark or Favored Foe.
    </p>
    <li>Swarm Keeper</li>
    <p>
        Swarm Keepers find themselves attuned to a small horde of nature spirits through the Ranger's connection to the natural world. Swarm Keepers tend to isolate themselves from the civilized world, strengthening their connection with their<br>
        spirit swarm. Those who do connect with people tend to subconsciously replicate a swarm, acting as an efficient unit and working in harmony. For strategy, at early levels you will likely find little use from the self-movement of Gathered Swarm, instead, you should aim for the damage<br>
        or if they are distanced from your melee allies, use the movement to draw them closer. On that note, because of all the abilities that deal with forced movement, you will find more value from this subclass as a ranged character. When you get Writhing Tide, you should spend most combats in the air as it's much harder to be hit. Once you have Mighty Swarm, you get even more versatility from your attacks, and the self-movement becomes more viable.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Rogue</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Phantom</li>
    <p>
        Rogues are infamously close to the line between life and death, known for taking high risks and the lives of their foes. Being so close to that wire, some Rogues develop a connection with death itself, basking in the negative energy of their victims<br>
        and withholding their souls to be used at the Rogue's leisure. Becoming similar to ghosts themselves, Phantoms are known to work with others close to death, such as being a necromancer's right hand or an agent of a God of Deaths temple.<br>
        The first thing of note in this subclass is that you have no unique way to perform a Sneak Attack, meaning you'll have to rely on getting advantage or having an ally next to the creature. Wails from the Grave allows you to spread some damage from your Sneak Attacks, which makes them deal objectively more damage. Finally, your Tokens of the Departed provide an array of unique and interesting effects adding a lot of character to your character.
    </p>
    <li>Soulknife</li>
    <p>
        Assassins tend to kill with physical weapons, perhaps poison. Thieves use tools to break into their targets. A Soulknife ignores this need for physicality and opts instead to perfect the art of psionics, leaving no trace with the powers of their mind.<br>
        Soulknives hone their psionics to replicate classic Rogue tools of the trade, creating weapons and honing their skills. As a Soulknife, the first step is realizing that your kit is optimally designed for scouting and reconnaissance. Using abilities like Psychic Whispers<br>
        to keep in contact with your party while you investigate areas and enemies. Worth noting, unlike Psi Warrior Fighter, Soulknife's psionic abilities do not reference your Intelligence modifier, meaning you do not need to worry about having good Intelligence. Also, many of your psi dice abilities only spend the rolled dice if the outcome is in your favor, allowing you to throw them on rolls a little more recklessly.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Aberrant Mind</li>
    <p>
        Aberrant Minds have had their soul touched by an alien being, often one from beyond human comprehension. From the mind-bending power of these alien creatures, these Sorcerers draw forth psionic magics. As the aberrations your power is brought from can<br>
        you can force this psionic influence into the world to touch other minds and manipulate energy. Your later abilities give you some nice utility effects and burst potential, but the brunt of this subclass is in the lower-level abilities. One important thing<br>
        that can be easy to gloss over is that you can change the spells gained by your Psionic Spells feature whenever you gain a level. The new spells must be Divination or Enchantment, but they can be from Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard, giving you tons of options. Your Psionic Sorcery lets you get clever with your spell casting, possibly casting spells undetected.
    </p>
    <li>Clockwork Soul</li>
    <p>
        Clockwork Souls have their magic powered by the universal concept of order and subconscious law. Most commonly originating from Mechanus, a plane of order and clockwork efficiency. Especially in a realm of fantasy, your powers can seem<br>
        unconventional, but you understand that it's all a piece of the universal machine. In a game inspired heavily by chance, abilities based on balance and order work very well to defy that chance. Your Restore Balance and Trance of Order<br>
        are great for keeping a fight predictable and ensuring things go according to plan. Your Bastion of Law is a very nice defensive tool, and while it's restricted to one at a time, it does not technically have a limit on its uses. Having it on yourself or another full caster can help hold concentration and negate some of the low health risks.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Warlock</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Fathomless</li>
    <p>
        You share your pact with a creature of the deepest abyss. Some massive being from beneath the waves of your home world, the Plane of Elemental Water, or some alien realm, grants you gifts of arcane to spread their will. Some of these patrons<br>
        merely want to know more about the world above the ocean, while others wish a cataclysmic flood upon the surface world. This Warlock plays very well as a backline control and pepper build. Use your Tentacle of the Deeps as a melee brawler, hit enemies, and slow them.<br>
        Then, because they can't attack or get rid of your tentacle in any way, keep it on them and keep them slowed, preventing them from reaching you and your allies. Try to lean into this with your spells, taking options that also slow or hinder your enemies like Hunger of Hadar.
    </p>
    <li>The Genie</li>
    <p>
        Your pact was made with a very rare breed of elemental, a noble genie. These genies command swathes of territory in the elemental planes, as well as lesser genies and other elementals. These patrons tend to be very arrogant, openly taking pacts with Warlocks<br>
        just to increase their reach across planes. When building a genie, a vital choice to be made is which type of genie your patron is. They come associated with one of the 4 elemental planes. This decision determines some of your spells and chooses the damage type for your<br>
        Genie's Wrath and Elemental Gift. This decision falls upon you, whichever you think seems the most fun with the spells and associated typing. Also with Elemental Gift, use the fly speed often, as being in the air makes you much less vulnerable. Finally, use Sanctuary Vessel in place of one of your short rests daily. No downside and bonus to regained health.
    </p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Wizard</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Bladesinging</li>
    <p>
        Bladesingers, somewhat like War Mages, discard the idea that Wizards have to be separated from warriors. These Wizards learn a form of dancelike fighting technique, to blend their time spent studying magic with an expertise of melee combat.<br>
        This dance tends to entrance onlookers, as the Bladesinger blends beautiful arcs of their blade with devastating bursts of magic. While it can seem dangerous or unsettling, playing a Bladesinger requires you to discard some of what you know about Wizards.<br>
        These Wizards should have reasonably high scores in Strength or Dexterity alongside Intelligence, and you want to spend combat up in your enemies' faces. Preferably staying away from the more threatening enemies, Bladesingers can masterfully prance around the battlefield taking large groups of lesser enemies. Use spells to protect yourself, improve your fighting abilities, or deal with enemies your sword cannot. And when it comes to it, don't be too scared to duel tough foes, you may surprise yourself.
    </p>
    <li>Order of Scribes</li>
    <p>
        The magic of Wizards tends to be heavily tied to books and scrolls, with most spending years poring over research and spellbooks to learn their craft. Many Wizards will be seen with mounds of papers and scrolls and would give anything to access ancient libraries.<br>
        And of all Wizards, Scribes emulate this to the t. These Wizards often lie at the foundation of every other College, as they are the experts that catalogue, investigate, and record the magical secrets of the world. Ensure that you have your Wizardly Quill, Awakened Spellbook, and later your Manifest Mind, active at all times.<br>
        Your spell list is entirely up to you, as there is no recommended theme in this College. I will say, it's likely ideal to have a wide array of different spell effects and damage types, to get use of your ability to change damage types and to stay versatile. With Master Scrivener, I recommend choosing a spell you see yourself casting often, especially if it gets enhanced when upcast. This will help conserve spell slots and improve upon something you'd be doing anyway.
